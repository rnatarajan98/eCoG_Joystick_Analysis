# eCoG_Joystick_Analysis
An exercise in neural decoding recorded using eCoG, during a joystick moving task.

Patients were asked to move a cursor to follow a target moving in a circular path on the screen. Voltage recordings were measured using eCoG technology over a wide region of the brain. Here we attempt to locate areas of correlation between the cursor movement and recorded eCoG voltages, in order to create a predictive model which may inform BCI/BMI behaviour.

Data is downloaded in the first code cells of the scrips. It is not included as a file in the repository.

Data obtained through neuromatch academy, initially obtained experimentally by G Schalk et al. as per https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/4/3/012
